                <p>My story begins not with credentials, but with collapse. Years ago, I found myself unable to function anxious, burned out, disconnected from my body, trapped in patterns I couldn't name.</p>
                <p>Therapy helped me understand my mind. Yoga taught me to feel my body. Reiki showed me energy exists. Astrology gave me timing and self-awareness. NLP and hypnotherapy rewired my subconscious. Ayurveda brought me back to daily rhythm.</p>
                <p>But none of them alone was enough. The breakthrough came when I stopped seeing them as separate tools and started weaving them into one integrated practice.</p>
                <p>That's when everything shifted. My nervous system regulated. My patterns released. My life aligned. And I knew I had to share this with others.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title text-center mb-4">Our Philosophy</h2>
                <div class="philosophy-box mb-4">
                    <h4>Healing Happens in Regulation</h4>
                    <p>You can't heal in a dysregulated nervous system. Before we chase insights or set intentions, we create safety in your body. That's where transformation begins.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="philosophy-box mb-4">
                    <h4>Ancient Wisdom + Modern Science</h4>
                    <p>Astrology isn't superstition it's archetypal psychology. Energy healing isn't woo it's nervous system regulation. We honor ancient practices while grounding them in neuroscience and somatic psychology.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="philosophy-box mb-4">
                    <h4>Integration Over Isolation</h4>
                    <p>Your mind, body, energy, and environment are not separate. True healing addresses all layers simultaneously, not sequentially.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="philosophy-box mb-4">
                    <h4>You Are Not Broken</h4>
                    <p>Your patterns made sense once. Your body is protecting you. Healing isn't about fixing it's about releasing what no longer serves and remembering who you are beneath the conditioning.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Why Celestial Mindworks Exists</h2>
                <p class="lead">Because healing shouldn't require a decade of trial and error.</p>
                <p>Most people bounce between modalities trying therapy, then yoga, then energy work never knowing how to integrate them. They get pieces of insight but not lasting transformation.</p>
                <p>Celestial Mindworks exists to offer what I wish I'd had: a unified approach that honors your complexity, regulates your nervous system, and aligns your life at every level mind, body, energy, and environment.</p>
                <p>This is not about transcending your humanness. It's about coming home to it.</p>
